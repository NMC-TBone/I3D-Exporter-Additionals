# i3d_exporter_additionals


## Description

Some additional tools that work along with [Giants i3d Exporter](https://gdn.giants-software.com/download.php?downloadId=92) for Blender.
Some of the tools you will find in this addon are inspired by the tools in Giants Maya i3d Exporter.

**Note**
*The mirror material don't export correctly to i3d yet, due to missing attributes within the i3d exporter.*
